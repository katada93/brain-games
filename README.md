«Brain games» - is a set of five console games. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Wrong answers complete the game and offer to pass it again.
 

Games:
* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
* Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Determination of an even number.
* Determination of a prime number.
* Determination of the greatest common divisor.
